## Features

1. Go to the extension options page by right-clicking the extension icon and selecting "Options."
2. Add or remove subreddits from the list provided.
3. Save your changes.

## Permissions

## Privacy

This extension does not collect or store any personal information. It only fetches public posts from Reddit.

## Support
